The KIBAGA kids placemat set of 4 is a true gem for any family with toddlers and young kids, as it combines the practical aspect of a placemat with a creative and educational benefit. The trendy design makes children's eyes shine: bright, colorful & with funny images. The kitchen table mats for kids come in a set of four different designs, each having their own mission in terms of being an exceptional learning tool: Alphabet: Learn the ABC and improve vocabulary building, starting with images (‘U for unicorn’) and adding new ideas. Numbers: How many elephants can you see? Learn numbers and count up to 10. Shapes: Which is the blue shape? Get to know different shapes as well as colors. Red, orange, yellow, green - so many colors and more can be seen! Integrating the kids placemats into your kids daily eating routine will also improve the eating behavior of your toddlers and encourage them to stay seated during mealtime. Why not introduce different games to support them in memorizing all new information and boost everyone's creativity at the same time? Approved by mums, dads and kids: Each children placemat (17.2x11.8”) is made of polypropylene, a-BPA free food grade material. Using a 0.6mm PP 4 color process print and screen print anti-slip gloss oil, creates a durable coating resulting in two major benefits: the child's placemat is non-slip and super easy to clean for you.
